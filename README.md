# Stata jMetrik Integration
Early work in progress to integrate the [jMetrik](http://www.itemanalysis.com) psychometrics program with Stata.  See [jMetrik GitHub Repository](https://github.com/meyerjp3/jmetrik) and the corresponding [Psychometrics Java Library](https://github.com/meyerjp3/psychometrics) for additional information.

# News
After wrestling with [Stata Java Utilities](https://github.com/wbuchanan/StataJavaUtilies) a bit, the package is now compatible across both versions of the [Stata Java API](http://www.stata.com/java/api).  The primary differences exist in how observation indices must be handled internally.

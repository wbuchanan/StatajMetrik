Project page for [Stata](http://www.stata.com) and [jMetrik](http://www.itemanalysis.com) integration.  The goal of the project is to make the capabilities of [jMetrik](http://www.itemanalysis.com) and the [Java Psychometrics](https://github.com/meyerjp3/psychometrics) available to users of [Stata](http://www.stata.com) with a familiar API.  Currently, the package only includes methods for the Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimator of Binary Items fitted with a Rasch model.  As time permits additional methods will be made available.  Over time this will likely require the generation of a new Stata API that would likely mirror the syntax structure of the `irt` commands currently available (e.g., jmetrik raschjmle, jmetrik 4pl, etc...).
